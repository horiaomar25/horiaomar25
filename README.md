# üí´ About Me:
I'm a former teaching assistant on my way to a career change in tech. <br><br>I have a degree in History. <br><br>I embarked on a career in teaching, which was a very rewarding experience. <br><br>However, I found that I missed learning about new concepts like I had when I was studying History at university.<br><br>I came across software engineering/development when searching on the internet. <br><br>After watching a couple of videos on HTML and CSS, I found I was really curious about coding. <br><br>I bought a Udemy course and got stuck into it. I loved it!<br><br>It was everything that I enjoyed. <br><br>Programming/coding was creative, challenging, and really required me to think.
